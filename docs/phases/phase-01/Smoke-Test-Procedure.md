# Smoke Test Procedures - Phase 1 Baseline

**Last Updated**: November 23, 2025

**Purpose**: Document current seed project behavior as baseline for regression detection

This is a **baseline measurement**, not a quality assessment:

- We record what the application does today (including any quirks or limitations)
- We use this baseline to detect regressions during migration phases
- We do NOT fix seed project issues - we preserve current behavior during migration

**Why this matters**: Successful migration means "works the same in .NET 9 on Azure as it did in Framework 4.8 locally" - not "works perfectly." This baseline tells us what "the same" means.

**Test Data State**: This procedure assumes the application is running with the original sample dataset included in the seed project.

------

## ⚠️ Security Notes

- Test credentials are documented in `/docs/test-accounts.md` (not committed to git)
- Do not commit completed test results containing credentials or production data

------

- [ ] ## Prerequisites

  - [ ] **Fresh database state verified** (see Database State below)
  - [ ] Application running locally on IIS Express
  - [ ] Browser DevTools (F12) available for console monitoring
  - [ ] Test accounts document accessible

  ### Database State

  This smoke test assumes **fresh seed data** from the application's database initializer.

  **Before starting smoke test**, verify database state:

  **Option 1: Drop and Reseed (Recommended for Phase 1 baseline)**
  ```sql
  -- Connect to (LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB
  DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS MvcMusicStore;
  DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS MvcMusicStoreUsers;
  ```
  Then start the application—databases auto-recreate with seed data.

  **Option 2: Verify Without Dropping**
  Only use this if you're certain databases are clean (no test data pollution):
  ```sql
  -- Verify expected counts
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Albums;   -- Should be 462
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Artists;  -- Should be 303
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Genres;   -- Should be 10
  ```

  **Why this matters**: Smoke test results must reflect seed project behavior, not accumulated test data. Stale cart items, test orders, or modified albums invalidate the baseline.

  **When to drop databases**:
  - ✅ Before Phase 1 baseline documentation (this smoke test)
  - ✅ Before Phase 2 Azure migration (pre-migration snapshot)
  - ✅ Before Phase 4 .NET 9 validation (clean comparison)
  - ✅ Any time test results seem inconsistent

------

## Page Coverage

Test all 12 pages in the following order:

1. Home Page
2. Store Index
3. Store Browse (Rock genre)
4. Store Details (Album ID 1)
5. Shopping Cart
6. Checkout (authenticated)
7. Checkout Complete
8. Admin - StoreManager (authenticated, admin role)
9. Create a New Album (authenticated, admin role)
10. Register Page
11. Login Page
12. Store Manager Page (authenticated, visitor role)

------

## Test Execution Instructions

### For Each Page:

1. **Navigate** to the page URL
2. **Visual Check**: Record what displays - all elements, any quirks, missing items
3. **Console Check**: Open F12 → Console tab, capture any errors or warnings present
4. **Document Behavior**: Record observations in the Results section (see template below)
5. **Screenshot**: Optional - take if it helps document unusual behavior

### Documentation Status:

Use these labels when recording results:

- **✅ Documented**: Page behavior captured completely
  - Record what you see, including any console warnings or visual quirks
  - Example: "Page loads, shows 3 albums, jQuery deprecation warning in console"
- **⚠️ Needs Investigation**: Behavior seems wrong but unclear if it's seed project quirk or real problem
  - Example: "Album art missing on details page - is this expected?"
  - Example: "Form validation message shows 'undefined' - seed project bug or environmental?"
- **🚫 Blocked**: Cannot document page behavior due to blocker
  - Example: "Page returns 500 error - cannot proceed"
  - Example: "Login completely broken - cannot test authenticated flows"

### Critical Distinction:

**Console errors ARE NOT test failures** - they're observations to document.

If you see:

- Console warning about jQuery → Document it as current behavior
- Missing image icon → Document it as current behavior
- Layout slightly misaligned → Document it as current behavior

Only mark **Blocked** if you literally cannot see the page or complete the user flow.

## Results Documentation

### Results Documentation Philosophy

Your results file should answer: "What does the seed project do today?"

**Good baseline documentation**:

- Records behavior accurately (console warnings, quirks, visual issues)
- Distinguishes seed project characteristics from environmental problems
- Flags only true blockers (cannot document behavior at all)
- Provides enough detail for Phase 4 regression testing

**Bad baseline documentation**:

- Treats console warnings as failures
- Lists visual quirks as "issues to fix"
- Judges quality instead of documenting behavior
- Provides pass/fail without context

Remember: If the page loads and you can interact with it, you have successfully documented the baseline - even if that baseline includes quirks.

------

After completing smoke tests, document your findings:

1. **Create results file**: `/docs/baselines/phase1-smoke-test-results-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Include**:
   - Test metadata (date, tester, environment details, git commit SHA)
   - Documentation status for each of the 12 pages
   - Screenshots attached to any unusual behavior (stored in issue tracker, not git)
   - Detailed observations with classifications
3. **Commit** results file with descriptive message

### Results Template Structure

```markdown
# Phase 1 Smoke Test Results

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Tester**: [Your Name]
**Environment**: Local IIS Express
**Build/Commit**: [Git SHA]
**Test Date**: [Date]
**Test Data State**: [Fresh seed data from original seed projec/ enhanced seed data with users and orders / Other]

## Baseline Documentation Status

**Overall**: ✅ COMPLETE | ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION | 🚫 BLOCKED

**Summary**:
- Pages Documented: X / 12
- Pages Needing Investigation: X
- Pages Blocked: X
- Regression Risks Identified: X (behaviors to verify in Phase 4)
- Known Limitations Captured: X (quirks to preserve)

## Page Results

### 1. Home Page - ✅ Documented

**Observations**:
- All expected elements display correctly
- 3 featured albums shown (IDs 1, 5, 7)
- Console: 1 warning present (jQuery Migrate deprecation - KNOWN LIMITATION)
- Genre nav shows 10 genres with album counts

**Regression Risks**: 
- Featured album count (verify count=3 post-migration)

---

### 2. Store Index - ✅ Documented

**Observations**:
- Genre list complete (10 genres)
- Album counts display correctly per genre
- Minor alignment issue on genre names (text slightly off-center - KNOWN LIMITATION)

**Regression Risks**:
- Genre count accuracy (verify all 10 genres present post-migration)

---

### 8. Admin (StoreManager) - ⚠️ Needs Investigation

**Observations**:
- Album list displays (50 albums total)
- Page title shows "Index" instead of "Store Manager" (KNOWN LIMITATION per seed docs)
- Noticed: Create/Edit/Delete links work but Delete shows confirmation page, not modal

**Needs Investigation**:
- Delete confirmation: Is full page navigation expected, or should this be modal/AJAX?
- **Resolution needed before Phase 2**: Review seed project source to confirm intended behavior

---

### X. [Example Blocked Page] - 🚫 Blocked

**Blocker**: Login page throws NullReferenceException when clicking "Log in" button (regardless of credentials)

**Console Error**:
```

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'submit' of null at login.js:15

```
**Impact**: Cannot test any authenticated flows (Checkout, Admin pages)

**Next Steps**: 
1. Review seed project GitHub issues for known login bugs
2. Check local environment (IIS Express, .NET Framework version)
3. If seed project bug: Document decision to fix vs use different seed project

## Detailed Observations

### Observation #1: [Descriptive Title]

**Page**: [URL where observed]
**Classification**: [Regression Risk | Known Limitation | Blocker]
**Browser**: [Chrome/Edge + version]

**Description**: [What you observed]

**Current Behavior**:
1. [What happens step by step]
2. [Include any console messages]
3. [Note any visual quirks]

**Why This Matters**:
- If Regression Risk: [Explain why this must work the same post-migration]
- If Known Limitation: [Explain why we're preserving this quirk]
- If Blocker: [Explain why this prevents baseline documentation]

**Console Output** (if relevant):
```

[Paste exact console messages]

```
**Screenshot**: [Optional - attach if helpful for documentation]

**Phase 4 Test Implication**: [What test case does this inform?]
```

### Baseline Observations Classification

When documenting behaviors in your results file, use these categories:

#### ⚠️ Regression Risk (Track These - They Become Test Cases)

Behaviors that MUST be preserved during migration:

- Form validation patterns (client-side vs server-side)
- Error message text and formatting
- Page load sequences and redirects
- Data display formats (currency, dates, counts)

**Example observations**:

- "Checkout accepts empty fields - validation is server-side only"
- "Genre page shows empty list when no albums - not an error message"
- "Cart total updates on page reload, not dynamically"

**Why track these**: Phase 4 tests must verify these behaviors persist post-migration.

------

#### 📝 Known Limitation (Document and Preserve)

Seed project quirks that are intentional or acceptable:

- Console warnings (jQuery versions, deprecated APIs)
- Visual inconsistencies (minor styling issues)
- Missing features noted in seed project docs
- Simplified implementations (no pagination, basic search)

**Example observations**:

- "Console warning: jQuery Migrate deprecation message - present in seed project"
- "Album details page uses thumbnail only, not full-size art"
- "StoreManager page title shows 'Index' not 'Store Manager'"
- "No 'forgot password' link on login page"

**Why document these**: Prevents "fixing" them during migration and introducing scope creep.

------

#### 🚨 Blocker (Investigate Before Migration Begins)

Issues that prevent establishing baseline:

- Application won't run or crashes
- Database connection failures
- Core user flows completely broken (login fails for all users)
- Pages return 500 errors consistently

**Example observations**:

- "Login page throws NullReferenceException for all test accounts"
- "Application fails to start - missing web.config connection string"
- "Database seed script fails - cannot populate test data"

**Why these are different**: You can't migrate what you can't measure. These must be resolved to establish baseline.

**Note**: A quirky implementation is NOT a blocker. "Login form doesn't validate empty fields client-side" is a known limitation. "Login button does nothing and console shows JavaScript crash" is a blocker.

------

## Common Baseline Documentation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Page Loads But Has Console Errors

**What you see**: Home page displays correctly, but console shows jQuery warning

**How to document**:

- Status: ✅ Documented
- Classification: Known Limitation
- Note: "Console warning present - jQuery Migrate deprecation message"

**What NOT to do**: Mark page as failed or blocked

------

### Scenario 2: Visual Element Looks Wrong

**What you see**: Album art appears as small thumbnail instead of large image

**How to document**:

- Status: ✅ Documented
- Classification: Known Limitation (check seed project - might be intentional)
- Note: "Album details uses thumbnail only - no large image available"

**What NOT to do**: Assume this is a bug without checking seed project design

------

### Scenario 3: Feature Seems Missing

**What you see**: Login page has no "forgot password" link

**How to document**:

- Status: ✅ Documented
- Classification: Known Limitation
- Note: "No password recovery feature - absent in seed project by design"

**What NOT to do**: Treat missing features as failures (seed project scope is limited)

------

### Scenario 4: Something Actually Broken

**What you see**: Clicking "Add to Cart" throws exception, page crashes

**How to document**:

- Status: 🚫 Blocked
- Classification: Blocker
- Note: "Add to Cart throws NullReferenceException - cannot complete checkout flow testing"

**What to do next**: Investigate if this is environmental (your setup) or seed project bug

------

### Decision Framework: Is This a Blocker?

**Ask yourself**: "Can I document what the page currently does?"

- **YES, I can see the page and describe its behavior** → ✅ Documented (even if quirky)
- **NO, I need to investigate if this is expected** → ⚠️ Needs Investigation
- **NO, the page is completely broken** → 🚫 Blocked

**Example**:

- "Form doesn't validate empty fields" = Documented (might be server-side only)
- "Form submits but I get HTTP 500 error" = Blocked (cannot complete flow)

------

## Testing Tips

### Console Monitoring

- Keep DevTools console open during entire test session
- Clear console between pages (🚫 icon) for accurate per-page results
- Record both errors (red) and warnings (yellow) - they're all part of the baseline

### Screenshot Strategy

- Only capture screenshots if they help document behavior
- Use browser's full-page screenshot tool (DevTools → Ctrl+Shift+P → "screenshot")
- Attach screenshots to issue tracker entries, not in git repository

### Environment Consistency

- Test on the same machine/browser throughout Phase 1
- Note any environmental changes (Windows updates, IIS restarts) in results
- Retest if environment significantly changes

### When to Stop and Investigate

**Stop baseline documentation if**:

- 🚫 Multiple pages blocked (cannot document current behavior)
- 🚫 Core flows completely broken (login, database connection)
- 🚫 Application won't start or crashes immediately

**Continue documenting if**:

- ✅ Pages load with console warnings (document the warnings)
- ✅ Visual quirks present (document as known limitations)
- ✅ Features missing or simplified (document as seed project scope)

**Investigate before migration if**:

- ⚠️ Behavior seems wrong but you're unsure if it's intentional
- ⚠️ Same issue appears across multiple pages (might be environmental)
- ⚠️ Core business logic behaves unexpectedly (empty cart shows $0 vs error message)

**Remember**: Quirky but consistent behavior is documentable. Broken, inconsistent, or crashing behavior is a blocker.

------

## Key Reminders for Baseline Documentation

**What success looks like**:

- Every page has documented observations (even if they include quirks)
- Console warnings are captured, not treated as failures
- Known limitations are distinguished from blockers
- You have enough detail to write Phase 4 regression tests

**What success does NOT require**:

- Zero console errors
- Perfect visual presentation
- All features implemented
- Professional polish

**The goal**: Accurate measurement of current state, not quality judgment.

If you complete this smoke test and your summary shows "8 pages documented with 12 known limitations," you have succeeded - even though that sentence includes the word "limitations."
