# Security Findings — Baseline

**Repository:** Repo 1 (Legacy ASP.NET MVC)
 **Purpose:** Establish and document the initial security posture prior to remediation or migration work.

------

## Baseline Capture Details

- **Captured on:** 2025-12-16
- **Commit SHA:** `3c96f8660f75fed54d0aafda38c394939b4772ea`
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Scan tools:**
  - GitHub Dependabot (default configuration)
  - GitHub CodeQL (default workflow template for C# / ASP.NET)

------

## Summary

This document captures the **initial security scan baseline** for the legacy application by enabling GitHub **Dependabot** and **CodeQL**.
 No dependency upgrades, configuration changes, or code remediation were performed as part of this baseline.

All findings reflect the **state of the repository as committed** and serve as a reference point for future remediation and migration phases.

------

## Scope

**Included**

- Enabling Dependabot
- Enabling CodeQL using GitHub’s default workflow
- Capturing and documenting initial findings
- Distinguishing high-signal findings from known noise

**Excluded**

- Dependency upgrades
- Code changes
- Security hardening
- Configuration remediation
- Production deployment considerations

------

## Dependabot Baseline

Dependabot identified the following outdated dependencies at baseline.
 No upgrade PRs were merged as part of Repo 1.

### Dependabot Recommendations (verbatim)

The following entries preserve the exact text generated by Dependabot to reduce the risk of data loss or reinterpretation:

| Recommendation                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bump Newtonsoft.Json from 13.0.3 to 13.0.4 dependencies .NET |
| Bump Microsoft.Owin.Security.OAuth from 3.0.1 to 4.2.3 dependencies .NET |
| Bump Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation from 3.2.11 to 4.0.0 dependencies .NET |
| Bump Microsoft.AspNet.WebPages from 3.2.9 to 3.3.0 dependencies .NET |
| Bump Microsoft.AspNet.Razor from 3.2.9 to 3.3.0 dependencies .NET |
| Bump Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc from 5.2.9 to 5.3.0 dependencies .NET |
| Bump jQuery.Validation from 1.19.5 to 1.21.0 dependencies .NET |
| Bump jQuery from 3.7.0 to 3.7.1 dependencies .NET            |
| Bump bootstrap from 5.2.3 to 5.3.8 dependencies .NET         |

### Interpretation

These findings establish that the repository contains **known outdated dependencies**, which is expected for a legacy codebase.
 Remediation is intentionally deferred and will be addressed in later repositories/phases.

## CodeQL Baseline

*Figure 2 — GitHub CodeQL alert summary captured at baseline.*

CodeQL was enabled using GitHub’s default workflow template for C# / ASP.NET projects.

### Findings Overview

CodeQL surfaced several issues, primarily clustered into the following categories:

------

### 1. Debug Configuration in Web.config (High)

- ASP.NET debug mode enabled
- Debug binaries may reveal sensitive information

**Assessment:**
 High-signal finding. Acceptable to record at baseline; unacceptable for production.

------

### 2. Missing Security Headers (High)

- Missing `X-Content-Type-Options`
- Missing `X-Frame-Options`

**Assessment:**
 High-signal finding. Typical for older ASP.NET MVC templates.

------

### 3. Missing CSRF Validation (Medium)

- Forms missing anti-forgery validation

**Assessment:**
 Medium-signal finding. Requires application-level remediation and test coverage in later phases.

------

### 4. Regex-Related Warnings in Vendored Files (Low / Noise)

- Findings related to `jquery.validate-vsdoc.js`

**Assessment:**
 Low-signal. This file is IntelliSense / documentation-only and not executed at runtime.
 Recorded for completeness but not considered a security risk.

------

## Known Noise and Limitations

- Vendored IntelliSense files generate low-value alerts
- Legacy ASP.NET MVC patterns trigger predictable CodeQL warnings
- No attempt was made to tune or suppress CodeQL rules during baseline capture

------

## Follow-Up (Intentionally Deferred)

The following items are **explicitly deferred** and tracked outside Repo 1:

- Dependency upgrades
- Web.config hardening
- Security header implementation
- CSRF protection enforcement
- CodeQL rule tuning or suppression

These actions will be addressed in subsequent repositories aligned with migration and modernization phases.
